# Prove It!

The name of this project is "Prove It".
It started on July 5, 2019, by a group of young people in Munich,
who realized that there's really a need of thorough understanding of the statements they made while explaining the truth to others.

Hopefully these records and proofs could be helpful to you too.

### How to Write a Post?

Each post you see on the website actually comes from a corresponding file in **_posts** folder.

So to write a new post is just to write something into a new file in that folder!
But before you check that out,
you may want to know [how to add a new file in your repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-new-files).

Normally, to make changes in the repository, you need to,

1. Clone this repository to your computer
1. Make some changes (add / delete / edit files)
1. Commit and upload the changes

And you may have to learn several commands to do that.

Fortunately, GitHub does provide online editor.
So you may want to know [how to edit files online](https://help.github.com/en/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository).

Now [click and go into the folder](_posts), and you will see a tutorial there.
