You may know God is almighty and He's the Great Creator.
But have you ever heard that God is alone?

The following two verses are Jesus' word and God's word.
And they clearly show that God is alone before the Reproduction and before the Creation of man.

John 12:24
: ... Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides *alone*; ...

Isaiah 44:24
: ... I am Jehovah who makes all things, / Who alone stretches out the heavens, / Who spread out the earth (*Who was with Me?*);

We can also combine two verses from Genesis to see that God is alone.
Man was made in His image, and the man was alone at that time.
In God's thought, it's not good for the man to be alone,
which might also mean that God didn't want to be alone.

Genesis 1:26
: And God said, Let Us make man in Our image ...

Genesis 2:18
: And Jehovah God said, It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper as his counterpart.
