Matthew 16:18
: And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.

-Most prophesies are included in this prophecy.

Eph 5:32
:  This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.

Matt 11:11 - greatest refers to a ranking system.
: Truly I say to you, Among those born of women there has not arisen one **greater** than John the Baptist, yet he who is least in the kingdom of the heavens is **greater** than he.

Eph 5:25
: Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her
Eph 5:26
: That He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word,
Eph 5:27
: That He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish.

-Dying for the church implies that prophecy regarding the church is greater than those concerning His death.

1 Cor 14:26
: What then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let **all things** be done for building up.
