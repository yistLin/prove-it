When we state that God is love, we need to prove it with scriptures.

> In the Bible the image of God refers to what God is.
> God is love, light, holiness, and righteousness.
> Therefore, love, light, holiness, and righteousness are what God is, hence, His image.
> Ephesians 4:23 and Colossians 3:10 clearly say that we need to be transformed and renewed into the image of the Lord.
> Godâ€™s image is love, light, holiness, and righteousness in reality.[^1]

1 John 4:8
: He who a does not love has not known God, because *God is love*.

1 John 4:16
: And we know and have believed the love which God has in us. *God is love*, and he who abides in love abides in God and God abides in him.

I think these verses are clear enough to prove that God is love.
