2 Cor 3:17
: And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.

2 Cor 3:18
: But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.

Onyx and other precious stones are produced by a process of transformation.
It is the process of intense heat, pressure, and time.
The Spirit is transforming us into precious stones through the process of transformation.
