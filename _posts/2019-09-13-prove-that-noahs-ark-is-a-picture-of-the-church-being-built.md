1 Pet 3:21
: Which water, as the antitype, also now saves you, that is, baptism, not a putting away of the filth of the flesh but the appeal of a good conscience unto God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
- "Which water, as the antitype, also now saves you" the "you" here in greek is "us."

Matt 24:37
:For just as the days of Noah were, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.
Matt 24:38  
:For as they were in those days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day in which Noah entered into the ark,
Matt 24:39  
:And they did not know that judgment was coming until the flood came and took all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.
