Anything you create is in some way a reflection of yourself.
Thus, there needs to be a moral standard in the Bible that it can still be authored by God.

Matthew 5:17-48

Genesis 17:1
: And when Abram was ninety-nine years old, Jehovah appeared to Abram and said to him,
I am the All-sufficient God; / Walk before Me, and be perfect.

John 8:7
: But when they persisted in questioning Him, He stood up and said to them, He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.

Luke 23:34
: And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing. And dividing His garments, they cast lots.
