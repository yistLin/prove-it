In Genesis 1-2 and Revelation 21-22 you can see Godâ€™s eternal purpose because Satan is not yet in the picture, and we do not see Satan trying to deviate God's people from  His plan.

Also, the same materials in Genesis 1-2 are in Revelation 21-22, which include:

- Genesis
  - gold
  - bdellium
  - onyx

- Revelation
  - gold
  - pearl
  - precious stones
