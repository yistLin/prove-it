Obadiah 18
: And the house of Jacob will be a fire, / And the house of Joseph a flame; / And the house of Esau will be as **stubble**, / And they will burn among them and devour them; / And there will be no survivor / To the house of Esau, / For Jehovah has spoken.

Exo 15:7
: And in the greatness of Your excellence / You overthrew those who rose up against You. / You sent forth Your burning wrath; / It consumed them like **stubble**.

Mal 4:1
: For indeed the day comes, burning like a furnace, and all the proud ones and all the ones who act wickedly will be **stubble**; and the coming day will set them ablaze, says Jehovah of hosts, so that it will not leave them root or branch.

Psa 83:13
: O my God, make them like a tumbleweed, / Like **stubble** before the wind.
