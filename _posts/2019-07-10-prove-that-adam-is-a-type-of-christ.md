Adam in the Bible is a type of Christ.
And there are many similarities between the two.
But how do we prove that Adam is a type of Christ?
Fortunately, Paul the apostle has pointed that out in the Epistle to the Romans.

Romans 5:14
: But death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of *Adam*'s transgression, who is *a type of Him who was to come*.

1 Corinthians 15:45 says, the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.
This is one of the verses that compares Jesus with Adam.
And there are many likenesses that exist between them.
Thank the Lord that through Adam as a type of Christ, we see Your plan for man.
