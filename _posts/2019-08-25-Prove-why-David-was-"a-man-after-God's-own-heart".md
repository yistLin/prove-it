David was a man after God's heart and we should also be those that are after and according to God's heart. 

1 Sam 13:14
: But now your kingdom will not continue. Jehovah has sought **a man according to His heart for Himself**, and Jehovah has appointed him ruler over His people; for you have not kept that which Jehovah commanded you.

Acts 13:22
: And when He had deposed him, He raised up David for them as king, to whom also He testified and said, I have found David, the son of Jesse, **a man according to My heart**, who will do all My will.

1 Kings 8:17
: And it was on **David my fatherâ€™s heart to build a house for the name of Jehovah** the God of Israel;

This is how David received the title a man after God's heart
