1. Isaac and Jesus were both resurrected on the third day

   Gen 22:6

2. Isaac and Jesus were both the Fathers beloved

   Gen 22:2
   : And He said, Take now your son, your **only son**, **whom you love**, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a **burnt offering** on one of the mountains of which I will tell you.

   Matt 3:17
   : And behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is My Son, **the Beloved**, in whom I have found My delight.

3. Isaac and Jesus both followed the father's will

   Gen 22:6
   : And Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. And the two of them walked together.

   Matt 26:39
   : And going forward a little, He fell on His face and prayed, saying, My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will.

4. Isaac was obedient unto death

   Gen 22:9-10
   : And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son.

   Phil 2:8
   : And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross.

5. Isaac carried the wood for the burnt offering and walked to the top of Mount Moriah

   Gen 22:9
   : _as above_

   John 19:17
   : And bearing the cross for Himself, He went out to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha,

6) Isaac was offered to God as a burnt offering on Mount Moriah; Christ also was offered to God on the same mountain to fulfill the type of burnt offering.

Genesis 24 two chapters after Genesis where Isaac is sacrificed there is the story of Isaac getting married.
In this account of the marriage of Isaac, Abraham typifies God the Father, the servant typifies God the Spirit, Isaac typifies God the Son, and Rebekah typifies the chosen people of God, who will marry the Son and become His counterpart.
The entire New Testament is a record of the Triune God working together to gain a part of the human race to be the bride, the counterpart, of the Son (John 3:29; 2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:25-32; Rev. 19:7-9; 21:2, 9-10).
In eternity past God the Father had an eternal purpose and made an eternal plan to gain the church as a bride for His Son out of the human race (Eph. 3:8-11).
Then, in time, God the Father commissioned God the Spirit to carry out His plan by going to contact the chosen bride and bring her to God the Son to be His counterpart, His wife.
