Num 11:7
: Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium.

John 6:51
: I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever;
And the bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world.

Bdellium is in the garden of Eden and it comes from a tree. When a tree is cut the sap flows out. Once that sap hardens, it becomes bdellium

Luke 23:31
: For if they do these things with the **tree** full of sap, what will happen with the one that is dry?

John 15:1
: I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman.

John 1:4
: In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.

John 19:34
: But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.

Christ as the tree of life was cut on the cross and out from His side came the life of Christ to produce the Bdellium.
