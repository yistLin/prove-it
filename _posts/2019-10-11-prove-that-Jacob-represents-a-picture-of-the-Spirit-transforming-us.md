Genesis 25:26
: And after that his brother came forth, and his hand was holding on to Esauâ€™s heel, so his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.

Genesis 32:28
: And He said, Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have struggled with God and with men, and have prevailed.

2 Corinthians 3:18
: But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.


Genesis 32:25-33 Here we see that Jakob is being transformed during his "wrestling" with God.
