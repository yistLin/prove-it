1 Corinthians 15:45 says, the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.
And we know the last Adam is Christ, because Adam is a type of Christ.
And there are many similarities between the two.
But how do we prove that Adam is a type of Christ?
Fortunately, Paul the apostle has pointed that out in the Epistle to the Romans.

Romans 5:14
: But death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of *Adam*'s transgression, who is *a type of Him who was to come*.

Some may think that it's weird to say the things from the Old Testament are types for what happened in the New Testament.
But Jesus actually used many types in His speaking to the disciples.

Matthew 12:40
: For just as *Jonah* was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.

John 3:14
: And as Moses lifted up *the serpent* in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,

Jesus even told people the things in the Scriptures testify concerning Him.

Luke 24:27
: And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, He explained to them clearly in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.

John 5:39
: You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me.

John the Baptist told us that He is the Lamb of God, which many may have known.

John 1:29
: The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!

Peter showed us that the big water in the days of Noah signifies baptism.

1 Peter 3:20
: Who had formerly disobeyed when the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared; entering into which, a few, that is, eight souls, were brought safely through by water.

1 Peter 3:21
: Which water, as *the antitype*, also now saves you, that is, *baptism*, not a putting away of the filth of the flesh but the appeal of a good conscience unto God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,

Paul pointed out that the spiritual rock was Christ.
And he said that these things happened to them as examples, which were written for our admonition.

1 Corinthians 10:4
: And all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and *the rock was Christ*.

1 Corinthians 10:6
: Now these things occurred as examples to us, that we should not be ones who lust after evil things, even as they also lusted.

1 Corinthians 10:11
: Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were written for our admonition, unto whom the ends of the ages have come.
