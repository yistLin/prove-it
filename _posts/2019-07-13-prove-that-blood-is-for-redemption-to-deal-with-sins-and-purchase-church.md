When the soldier pierced Jesus' side, there came out blood and water.
And the blood is shed for for redemption.

First, we have to know that the redemption is through the blood.

Ephesians 1:7
: In whom we have *redemption through His blood*, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace,

And it deals with our sins.

Hebrews 9:22
: And almost all things are purified by blood according to the law, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.

Matthew 26:28
: For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.

1 John 1:7
: But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.

And the church was purchased by the blood.

Acts 20:28
: Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers to shepherd the church of God, which He *obtained through His own blood*.

Not only the church is purchased.
Even more, He have purchased every men.

Revelation 5:9
: And they sing a new song, saying: You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, for You were slain and have purchased for God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,
