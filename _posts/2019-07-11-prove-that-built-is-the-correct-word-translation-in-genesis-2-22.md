title: "Prove that 'Built' is the Correct Word Translation that Should Be Used in Genesis 2:22 Instead of 'Made', 'Fashioned' or Any Other Word Choice"

In Genesis 2:22, God took the rib from man and made a woman.
But was Eve merely "made" out of the rib?

Many versions of the Bible in the English language use words like, "made" (KJV, HCSB), "fashioned" (NASV) in this verse.
But if we look at the verb in Hebrew, it could be directly translated as "built".
It's the same word as used in Gen. 8:20 where Noah built an altar and in other verses where people built houses or cities.
Actually the same word[^1] are used more than 300 times in the Old Testament, and it is always "built".

Genesis 2:22
: And Jehovah God *built* the rib, which He had taken from the man, into a woman and brought her to the man.

Genesis 4:17
: And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch; and he *built* a city ...

Genesis 8:20
: And Noah *built* an altar to Jehovah ...

Basically people translated according to their understanding.
When they read that Eve was "built", they might think this is weird, and translated it into another word.
But for the word to be translated as "built" is really important.
Otherwise, people may not see the relation between Gen. 2:22 and Matt. 16:18, where Jesus said, I will "build" My church.

Matthew 16:18
: And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will *build My church*, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.

In the same principle, we should take a look at John 1:14.
Many Bibles in English language translated this verse to,
And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, ...
However, the word that was translated to "dwelt" actually is not just to dwell,
it also has the meaning, *to have one's tent*[^2].
Thank the Lord that He not only dwelt among us, He tabernacled among us!

John 1:14
: And the Word became flesh and *tabernacled* among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father), full of grace and reality.
