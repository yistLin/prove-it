Christ is about to marry the church as man marries woman.

Isaiah 54:5
: For your *Maker is your Husband*; Jehovah of hosts is His name. And the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; He is called the God of all the earth.

But the Bible does not just reveal that Christ is the Husband in the marriage, but that the church is female, too.

Ephesians 5:23
: For a husband is head of the wife as also Christ is Head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the Body.

Ephesians 5:25
: Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for *her*

Ephesians 5:26
: That He might sanctify *her*, cleansing *her* by the washing of the water in the word,

For the revelation of the marriage, it is important to realize that the church is even female, first.

<!-- Eph. 5:25 -->
