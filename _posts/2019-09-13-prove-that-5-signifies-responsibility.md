- 5 books of God's law and keeping the law implies responsibility.
- The Lord did not come to abolish the law. This implies that the law will not go away. The burden of the law is still there and we are responsible to still keep it.

    Matt 5:17
    : Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill.

    Matt 5:18   
    : For truly I say to you, Until heaven and earth pass away, one iota or one serif shall by no means pass away from the law until all come to pass.

    Matt 5:19   
    : Therefore whoever annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called the least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whoever practices and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.

    Matt 5:20   
    : For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.

- two tablets of 5 of the law.
- 2 sets of virgins in Matthew 25.
