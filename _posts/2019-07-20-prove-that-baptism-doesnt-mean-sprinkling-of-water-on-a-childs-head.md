title: "Prove That Baptism Doesn’t Mean Sprinkling of Water on an Infant’s Head"

\[ TO BE UPDATED \]

<!--
baptism is not sprinkling of water
- Mark 1:10 (coming up out of the water)
- Acts 8:38-39 (down into the water)

The word "baptize" in Greek means "immersion". (https://biblehub.com/acts/8-38.htm)

The translator didn't even translate this word by meaning, they just made a new word from the Greek word.

Why not as an infant?
- Mark 16:16 (believe and be baptized)
- Rom. 10:9 (confess with your mouth)

An infant cannot do that.
