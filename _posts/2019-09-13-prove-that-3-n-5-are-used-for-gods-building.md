: And of cassia **five hundred shekels**, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, and a hin of olive oil.

: And with it **you shall anoint the Tent of Meeting** and the Ark of the Testimony,

Isa 61:1

: And you shall make the altar of acacia wood, a length of five cubits and a width of five cubits; the altar shall be square; and three cubits, its height.

Exo 37:1

Eph 3:21
: To Him be **the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus** unto all the generations forever and ever. Amen.
