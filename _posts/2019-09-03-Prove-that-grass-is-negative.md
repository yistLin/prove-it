1 Pet 1:24
:For â€œall flesh is like **grass**, and all its glory like the flower of grass. The grass has withered, and the flower has fallen off,

Isa 40:6-8
: A voice said, Cry out. / And he said, What shall I cry? / All flesh is **grass** / And all its glory is like the flower of the field; The grass withers, the flower fades, / Because the breath of Jehovah blows upon it. / Surely the people are grass. The grass withers and the flower fades, / But the word of our God will stand forever.

Isa 51:12
: I, even I, am He who will comfort you. / Who are you that you are afraid of man who will die, / And of the son of man who will be made like **grass,**

James 1:10-11
: And the rich in his being brought low, because like a flower of the grass he will pass away. For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass, and its flower falls off, and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so also the rich man will fade away in his pursuits.
