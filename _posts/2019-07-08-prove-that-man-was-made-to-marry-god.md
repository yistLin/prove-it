Who is God, the Great Creator, to you?
God is your \_\_\_?
People may say He's my Father, my King, etc.
But have you heard that God, our Creator, made us to marry Him?

Isaiah 54:5
: For *your Maker is your Husband*; / Jehovah of hosts is His name. / And the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; / He is called the God of all the earth.

In this verse, Isaiah emphasized "Maker", not "King" or anything else.
Because for Him, our Maker, to be our Husband is the purpose we were made!
At that time, poeple of Israel loved many things other than God Himeself.
But God want us to know we're made to love and marry Him.
How amazing His purpose for man is!
