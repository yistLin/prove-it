Who is God, the Great Creator, to you?
God is your \_\_\_?
People may say He's my Father, my King, etc.
But have you heard that God, our Creator, made us to marry Him?

Isaiah 54:5
: For *your Maker is your Husband*; / Jehovah of hosts is His name. / And the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; / He is called the God of all the earth.



<!-- Isaiah 54:5 (we are "made" to marry God)

So God is our Maker.
And our Maker could be our Creater, brother, king, etc.
But He could be our Husband.

Israelites in the Old Testament loved so many other things.
And Jehovah God wanted them to know they're made to marry Him. -->
