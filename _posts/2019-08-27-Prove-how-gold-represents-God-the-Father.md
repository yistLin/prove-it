Job 22:25
: Then the Almighty will be your gold nuggets and precious silver to you.

Gold is thought to have been produced in supernova nucleosynthesis, and from the collision of neutron stars, and to have been present in the dust from which the Solar System formed. Because the Earth was molten when it was formed, almost all of the gold present in the early Earth probably sank into the planetary core. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold) Gold cannot be produced by men.

Gold also does not rust, aka never gets old.
