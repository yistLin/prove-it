\[ TO BE UPDATED \]

When you are told that a bone signifies the resurrection life, you may think it's a bit over-interpreted.
But do you know the bones of Elisha resurrected a man?
A bone can mean much more than you thought it could be.

2 Kings 13:20
: And Elisha died, and they buried him.
Now the bands of the Moabites would invade the land at the coming in of the new year.

2 Kings 13:21
: And it so happened that as the people were burying a man, they saw a band;
and they cast the man into the grave of Elisha.
And as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he came to life and stood up on his feet.

Elisha is a type of Christ.
Even the dead Elisha could enliven people.
This is a picture of Christ in resurrection.

Ephesians 5:29
: For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church,

Ephesians 5:31
: For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.

Ephesians 5:32
: This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.
