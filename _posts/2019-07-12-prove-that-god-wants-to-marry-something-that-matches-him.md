People, who want to marry someday, usually want to marry someone who matches them. They want their marriage partner to be around their age or to have similar features. Adam had the same desires. He tried to find a helper as his counterpart but he was without success because all the animals didn't match him. But eventually, he found his counterpart in Eve that was bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh.

Genesis 2:20
: And the man gave names to all cattle and to the birds of heaven and to every animal of the field, but for Adam there was not found a helper as his counterpart.

Genesis 2:23
: And the man said, *This time* this is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; this one shall be called Woman because out of man this one was taken.

Adam is a type of Christ.

Romans 5:14
: But death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is a type of Him who was to come.

Even as Adam, also Christ wants to marry someone who matches Him and He found His counterpart and wife in the church. His bride is going to be fully in the likeness of Christ at the day of the wedding feast.

Matthew 19:28
: And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that you who have followed Me, in the restoration, when *the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory*, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

Revelation 4:2
: Immediately I was in spirit: and behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and upon the throne there was One sitting;

Revelation 4:3
: And He who was sitting was *like a jasper stone* and a sardius in appereance, and there was a rainbow around the throne like an emerald in appereance.

Revelation 21:9
: And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.

Revelation 21:11
: Having the glory of God. Her light was like a most prescious stone, *like a jasper stone*, as clear as crystal.
