Christians talk about men being God’s creatures or men becoming God’s people.
But not many Christians have paid adequate attention to the fact that we are vessels of God.
In Romans 9, the Word tells us clearly that we are vessels.

Romans 9:21
: Or does not the *potter* have authority over the clay to make out of the same lump one *vessel* unto honor and another unto dishonor?

Romans 9:23
: In order that He might make known the riches of His glory upon *vessels of mercy*, which He had before prepared unto glory,

When God created man, He formed man as a vessel.
The Hebrew word for "formed"[^1] in Genesis 2:7 has the meaning[^2],

> **formed**
>
> וַיִּיצֶר֩ (way·yî·ṣer)
>
> Conjunctive waw \| Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular
>
> Strong's Hebrew 3335: To mould into a, form, as a, potter, to determine

A vessel is made to contain something.
And we are God's vessels to contain God!

Genesis 2:7
: Jehovah God *formed* man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.
