As Adam is a type of Christ, Eve is a type of the church.
But how do we see that in the Scriptures?

In 2 Corinthians 11, Paul described the church as a pure virgin to Christ.

2 Corinthians 11:2
: For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.

2 Corinthians 11:3
: But I fear lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your thoughts would be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity toward Christ.
